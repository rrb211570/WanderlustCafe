# Business website for Wanderlust Cafe

As a side passion hustle, I created a small business in 2022 to sell food at farmer's markets once a week. I sell seasonal, artisanal products made completely from scratch. I try to iterate 20+ times on a recipe before I end up with something satisfactory enough to showcase.

Currently, I am selling rasmalai, maple taro mochi, curry buns, and fruit tea. See [website].

App is made in MERRN and hosted on AWS Amplify, with server-side requests to AWS Lambda for managing user auth, email list, and Stripe integration.
