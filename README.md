# Business website for Wanderlust Cafe

As a side passion hustle, I created a small business in 2022 to sell food at farmer's markets once a week. 

The business [page] is made with MERRN and hosted on AWS Amplify, with server-side requests via AWS Lambda to handle user auth (from scratch), emailing (SendGrid), and payment processing (Stripe).
