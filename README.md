# Business website for Wanderlust Cafe

As a side passion hustle, I've been thinking about creating a small business to sell desserts at farmer's markets once a week. 

The [website](wanderlust-cafe.com) is made with MERN and hosted on Google Firebase, with server-side requests via Firebase functions for payment processing (Stripe).

For the theme, seasonality is an important idea when it comes to creating a menu with the best tasting ingredients. Similarly, I felt it would be good to design a theme that would support seasonal changes. The falling stripes of the transition page can abstractly represent the colors of the season, and can be changed every month to note the passing of time. The home page is currently blue with snowflakes to represent winter, but this can be changed to use glowing pastel lights (spring), floating sailboats and seagull swooshes fading in/out (summer), etc., to represent different seasons.
